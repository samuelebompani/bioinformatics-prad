Prostate cancer, the second most common cancer in men globally, is affected by factors such as age, family history, genetics, and race. It exhibits a spectrum of behaviors, from aggressive to indolent forms, in localized cases. Risk stratifi- cation systems have been established to predict disease progression and inform treatment choices using clinical and pathological factors. Incorporating molecu- lar features is critical in enhancing risk stratification and optimizing treatment strategies for prostate cancer.
